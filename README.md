# 353Project

project.py is the python program code for the project


Everything else is the data files from the movie data set. They have already been extracted for viewing.

# What has been done so far

1. See if audience average and critic average correlate with one another. Calculated the correlation coefficient and printed the value to see how they relate to one another.

2. See if the country of origin matters in the percentage of people who rate the movie (chi squared)

3.  See which country of origin contains the most movies

4. Split movies so one set contains movies from 2000 and before and the other is 2000 and after. Take the audience average of them both and do a mann whitney test to see if people like the older movies more or the newer ones
